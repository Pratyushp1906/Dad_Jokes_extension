# Dad_Jokes_extension
This project involves creating a Chrome extension that retrieves random jokes using the Dad Jokes API. 
The extension aims to serve as a productive tool that helps users de-stress. The technology stack used includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The extension's primary purpose is to provide users with a moment of levity and laughter during their busy day. By utilizing the Dad Jokes API, the extension will deliver a steady stream of jokes, each more groan-worthy than the last. 
Overall, this project is a fun and practical way to incorporate humor into a user's daily routine.
